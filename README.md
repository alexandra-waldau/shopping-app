This project was developed as the final assignment for the course 'Mobile app development' at the IT University of Copenhagen in Spring 2020.

## About 
The finished product is a shopping list application that allows the user to list items and where to shop them. The application was built using fragments to assemble the UI and a local SQLite database to store lists past the activity lifecycle.

## Features
* Add items to a list
* Select a shop from a pre-defined list or add a new one
* View all the items on the list
* Delete single or all items from the list
* Forward the list via an application of your choice
